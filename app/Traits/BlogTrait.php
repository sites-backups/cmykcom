            "slug"=> "custom-bottle-neckers-a-new-world-of-advertisement",
            "body"=> "<p>Since the evolution of product  advertisement , different promotion methods are adopted for improving products. Promotion methods are used to increase brand recognition and coverage. Promotion is done in many ways such as commercials, product quality, and product packing, etc. However, there is one unique method that is used to promote bottled products. This method is using a Custom Bottle Necker  for product advertisement . These Neckers do not provide safety or any other such feature but they are responsible for product promotion. Most bottles such as wines or fizzy drink bottles use these Neckers for promotions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Unique Advertisement</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many products are stacked on shelves of outlets and shops. These products belong to different brands and are competing with each other. Every brand desires that their product stands out from the rest. This requires excellent product presentation. Most of the brands provide good quality drinks. Most brands provide good-quality glass bottles filled with drinks. And many brands provide good box packing for their bottles. However, some brands take advertisement to next level and use a unique approach. These brands place Custom Bottle Neckers  on bottles to increase the presentation of bottles. This method is adopted by many beverage industries and many bottles can be seen with these items stacked on supermarket and outlet shelves.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Design Ideas for Bottle Neckers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Neckers are designed and inserted on the bottles to increase the promotion and presentation of products. However, to improve product presentation, these items must be designed in unique ways. Neckers are designed in stylish shapes whereas some are given a rectangular shape for a traditional look. Furthermore, most Neckers have a smooth finish and are colored with a dark shade. Apart from a smooth finish, matte and gloss finish are also applied on these items. Neckers are available mostly in cardboard material, the same material used to make boxes.  </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Customized Neckers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Boxes for storing items can be modified and customized. Similarly, Bottle Neckers  can be modified and customized for a stylish look. Customization can be done in several ways. Neckers can be transformed into multiple shapes and sizes all depending upon user demands. Matte, gloss, or plain finish can be selected by the user and produced with ease. Moreover, colors can be selected from a wide range to make these items stand out. Images and texts are added in stylish fonts that provide a vibrant look. In this way, a perfectly customized Necker provides extra advertisement  features for the bottle.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Inexpensive Yet Efficient</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the prime features of Neckers for Bottles is that they can be used in multiple ways. Neckers can be used instead of bottle boxes to provide an inexpensive selling method. Instead of spending bucks on a large number of boxes, users can label bottles with these Neckers. Prices, special features, and other useful information can be added to these Neckers. These advertisement items can overtake the boxes with ease. Boxes can become a thing of the past very soon with increased use of these Neckers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Custom Bottle Neckers  are efficient as well. These Neckers allow easy marketing of the bottle being delivered. Instead of using boxes and labeling them on all sides, a Necker can come in handy. Neckers are printed on one side only with only useful information. Useful information is usually the price and special features of the beverage or any promotion. This makes the user spend less time reading the bottle and decide instantly whether to buy or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Bottle Neckers?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The race for quick selling is getting faster each year. To compete in this race, brands focus on several things. Product quality, bottle, and packing quality are focused. Promoting the product is also essential for brand promotion. For these reasons, brands are working each year to improve advertisement methods for their products. <a href=\"https=>//bestcustomboxes.co.uk/product/bottle-neckers/\">Neckers are designed for bottles</a> for this very reason. The main reason for their popularity is that they are cheap compared to using a packing box. Apart from low prices, they effectively and precisely display useful information about products. These items will soon take the place of packing boxes and would be seen attached to many items.</p>",

Boxes are designed in a way to increase product visibility and promotion. Boxes nowadays have a see-through plastic material that provides a view of the product stored. Some boxes leave the space wide open so the user can touch and observe the product stored. These methods have made boxes a great source of promotion and customer attraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Stylish Packing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Boxes for storing bottles are available in various shapes, sizes, and designs. Custom Bottle boxes have designed cut-holes so that the bottles can be inserted into them. Inserted bottles are held tightly in those cut-holes thus increasing safety. Boxes are even crafted in a way that they include lifting portions which is another good marketing strategy. Sizes of boxes vary depending upon the bottle which is stored. Some boxes are available to accommodate more than one bottle. This consumes only one box and thus lesser space. Else patterns are included in boxes to provide a stylish outlook.

This allows shops and outlets to sell multiple soft drink bottles using one&nbsp;<a href=\"https=>//bestcustomboxes.co.uk/\">packing box</a>. Generally, soft drinks with plastic and glass bottles are stored in these boxes. For security, these boxes have dividers and padding material between bottles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Boxes for Canned Soft Drinks</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Canned soft drinks are also quite popular due to their small size and cheap prices. However, they can be stored in boxes for easy shipping or delivery. Half and dozen canned soft drinks are stored inside a single box and delivered with ease. Boxes used for canned soft drinks use the auto-lock feature and are smaller in size.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Boxes for Other Bottles</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A wide variety of boxes are available for storing various other bottles. These bottles include medicine syrups, jams, jellies, pickles, tomato and garlic sauces, etc. Boxes are designed to store and contain these boxes with safety and ease.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Safety</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cardboard boxes have increased strength and security compared to paper and plastic bags. This feature of boxes makes them a great alternative to paper and plastic bags. Custom Bottle boxes are used to store bottles with ease but with increased safety. Glass, as well as plastic bottles, can be easily stored in these boxes. However, glass requires extra care during packing. For this purpose, boxes for bottles have some padding materials such as soft cotton. This material separates bottles and prevents damage during jerks. Boxes also use dividers to increase the safety of stored bottles manifolds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, it is easier to stack boxes than products or items. Products such as bottles are stacked on shelves but not over another. Boxes resolve this problem. They can be stored and stacked over one another and thus use minimum space.</p>",

Meanwhile, the most commonly used materials for shoe packaging are corrugated, cardboard, rigid and kraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, let&rsquo;s have a look at a comparison between cardboard corrugated and rigid boxes&rsquo; material.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2> Cardboard Corrugated Shoe Boxes </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>These boxes are made with corrugated board which consist of multiple fluted sheets glued together. They are more sturdy and durable than plain cardboard sheets. This quality makes these boxes more preferable for semi-heavy products packaging like shoes.

But they can also cost you a little more than casual boxes. Thus, they are majorly used by renowned brands and for packing high-end products.

But it would require you to do a deep analysis of your product requirements, packaging demands, budget and your expectations for sales outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, despite the material you choose, you can have it created in custom shapes and sizes such as,  <a href=\"https=>//bestcustomboxes.co.uk/product/sleeve-boxes/\">sleeve boxes</a> , collapsible boxes, <a href=\"https=>//bestcustomboxes.co.uk/product/two-piece-boxes/\"> two piece boxes</a>  with window lid, one-piece boxes, and  <a href=\"https=>//bestcustomboxes.co.uk/product/mailer-boxes/\">mailer boxes</a> .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, both boxes have their own benefits and drawbacks.

No state was spared of it, although some were able to recover from it considerably, but they are only one or two. Whereas the rest of the world is still facing gruesome health challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, online shopping has become the safest choice. This shift has further empowered the digital market. Where the digital market was already growing considerably, now with the current situation, we can only determine it to be booming further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be said that the social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat were initially used for the sole purpose of socialization in the beginning. However, now play a crucial role in developing brand&rsquo;s image and marketing. So it has become mandatory for brands to design their  Custom Boxes  in the manner that appeal to their online buyers as well. The style that makes them stand out beautifully to the netizens and instantly urges them to buy the products.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <h2>Products Are Judged by Their Looks</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Although we have often heard the phrase, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t judge a book by its cover&rsquo;, the same rule does not apply to the product packaging anymore. The way you present your product in the retail market (although it is still limited) and on online platforms (websites and social media sites) plays a huge role in creating your brand image and attracting clients for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <a href=\"https=>//bestcustomboxes.co.uk/heres-why-you-need-to-get-a-box-sample-before-confirming-your-custom-packaging-order/\">Custom Packaging</a>  services, like ours, provide you with the freedom to design your  <a href=\"https=>//bestcustomboxes.co.uk/\">Custom Boxes</a>  on your own.

But for a brand, the two most important things are the logo, as it speaks about your brand&rsquo;s message, and the packaging because it is the first thing that interacts with your customers after they have made their purchase.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2> Different Colours and The Impact They Have on Customers </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are numerous colours now available in the market, but the primary colours are red, yellow, blue and green. The rest of the colours are seemed to be made after their different combinations. Meanwhile, as the  <a href=\"https=>//bestcustomboxes.co.uk/product/rigid-boxes/\">Rigid Boxes</a>  is used for luxury and expensive product packaging, so it gets more crucial to choose the right colour combination to not risk lowering your worthy brand status.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3> Blue </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The blue colour ignites the feeling of calmness, tranquillity, relaxation, authority, and peace. Therefore, it is often considered masculine and related to the sense of reliability. This makes it perfect for packaging your men or women&rsquo;s skincare products, cosmetics, gift and sports product packaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3> Green </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It gives the message of health, good luck, nature, growth, wealth, income, and harmony. This makes the colour perfect for the brands and products that claim to be climate-friendly and chemical-free. As it makes viewers think of recycle green logo, so it would develop the relevant feeling and make your customers trust you easily in this regard.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3> Purple </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Purple is the colour of royalty. It is associated with the mystical, magical, intriguing, problem solving, authoritative, imaginative, and spiritual vibes. So it is evidently perfect choice for high end  <a href=\"https=>//bestcustomboxes.co.uk/categories/\">product&rsquo;s packaging</a> . Moreover, it can be seen in banks, spas, cosmetics and serum boxes, makeup, and clothing brands. It makes your customers feel more interested and impressed by the product, subconsciously.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3> Red </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The colour of passion, high energy, love, and enthusiasm. However, it is also related with feelings like warmth, curiosity and confidence. It drives hunger, energy, and passion into whatever it is placed in. So if you own a food brand, and want your buyers to feel instant hunger, interest and mysterious urge to taste your food items, then this can be your best buddy. However, the  Rigid Boxes  material is not usually preferred for food packaging, but you can also get the same results by using the same psychology with other materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3> Orange and Pink </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The orange colour is specifically associated with the youthful feelings; affordability, humor, and change as well. This colour allows you to give the message of revolution, growth and relativity. It also allows you to friendly engage with your customers. Like for products like gym wear, athlete wears and items, it is a perfect choice as it indicates energy, intensity and change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas the colour pink gives more feminine, girly vibes, so it can be a suitable colour to add in toys and makeup packaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3> Yellow and Grey </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It refers to positivity, energy, cheerfulness, warmth, and danger. Therefore, we often find warning signs painted with yellow colour. Meanwhile, they can be a good option for food and makeup product packaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other side, grey is the formal, professional, and decent shade. It is mostly used in corporate sector; so you can use if for packaging office items, and <a href=\"https=>//bestcustomboxes.co.uk/product/business-card-boxes/\">business card packaging</a>. But its use can not be limited to the office products, it is also perfect to blend with white or black to packaging your high end men&rsquo;s apparels, accessories and perfumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3> Black and White </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The black, being blank and dark, is considered as powerful, and mystique that makes it perfect for numerous products. And the white, similarly, can be used for numerous products as it directs cleanliness, purity, and freshness. However, it also gives the cold and black look at first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the colours certainly induce different emotions, but the combination of them can magnify the impact and help you reach to your audience in more effective manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you combine various colours, you&rsquo;re not only mixing shades but also inviting different feelings at the same time in your customer&rsquo;s mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2> Because the colours matter! </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As all the colours are drawn from nature, and nature taught us what certain colors mean. So, it is best to use colours according to nature&rsquo;s rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mostly often, majority of the times people buy certain product just because they simply liked the product and colours on it, as per the findings of research conducted by the Seoul International Color Expo. This dictates that people make purchasing decisions based on what they expect from the colours they see and whether they feel the colors are doing what they are supposed to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, Carl Jung, one of the world&rsquo;s most influential psychologist, referred to colour as  mother tongue of the subconscious.&rdquo; He was a psychotherapist, behaviorist and so studied people&rsquo;s behaviour at much deeper level. His findings about the colour psychology and their link with human behaviours led him to develop art therapy; which is all about using different colours to evoke various emotions and feelings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it is not all about evoking certain emotions. It is also about using right colours to meet consumers&rsquo; expectations for products and brands. Consider colors that are bad fits for certain products or types of services, like a bright yellow and orange logo for a bank or a brown or gray box for feminine hygiene products. These colors feel wrong to us because they don&rsquo;t match our expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>What does it all mean?</em> It means that the colours you add in your  Rigid Boxes  play a huge role in directing how well your product does in the market. So you should be very considerate and educated about the colours you&rsquo;re choosing for your <a href=\"https=>//bestcustomboxes.com/\">product packaging</a> because they will be eventually driving your customers&rsquo; behavior&rsquo;s, and influencing their buying decisions, resultantly.</p>",

Many renowned brands like Walmart, have also introduced their sustainable <a href=\"https=>//bestcustomboxes.co.uk/\"> Custom   Packaging </a> goals in the last few years. Walmart is the world renowned retail store, so when it has taken this step then it means that the following brands will be making the similar efforts to not get lost among other brands and stay related to the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, we can see different independent brands coming up with nature friendly products and packaging solutions to help us reduce the pollution index. It also provides people with the opportunity to play their individual roles as well.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <h2>Corona Just Happened!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We all know that 2020 was the year that scared and confined us all to our homes. Thus, people will be becoming more cautious about natural conditions. They will be making their every effort to reduce planet waste and plastic consumption as they have already been shaken once with the deadly outcomes of natural havocs, and seeing how inefficient the world is in handling such situations, there is no chance we can handle another one in near future. We are, in fact, still failing miserably in handling the currently faced  <a href=\"https=>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic\">pandemic</a> . So forget about polluting the Earth further.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <h2>Consumer Conscience Drives Demand</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Nielsen&rsquo;s survey results showed that consumers are actually more willing to purchase products that provide sustainable solutions. We can see glass jars, glass straws, wooden culinary, wooden spoons and teeth brushes, and bamboo packaging styles becoming quite common and adored globally to replace plastic, whilst the kraft packaging remains most reliable choice when it comes to  Custom Packaging .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As per Futerra, a US based creative agency promoting sustainable solutions, recent survey that included over 1,000 consumers from the UK and USA, 96% of the people felt the social responsibility and wanted to be more contributing through their actions. Therefore, they were more willing and eager to go with the brands that offered them with the options to recycle, donate or ethically make the purchase without the guilt of producing more pollution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So this consciousness has also driven the <em>demand </em>for sustainable and if, due to any reason, some brands would still not choose to adapt to it. Then there are high risks of them getting outdated, and crumbled down in short time. As the market situation is already very tough, amid the saturation and competition ratio, so brands will have to switch their packaging approach as per the consumer demands. Otherwise, customers would not take much time in prioritizing other brands over them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, there are also definitely opportunities for companies to gain competitive advantage through the development of an environmentally friendly strategy without sacrificing product quality or consumer convenience.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <h3>Less Wastage, More Productivity and Optimisation</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Where it is beneficial for the society from climate perspective, it is also advantageous for brand owners as well. As you will be switching towards recycling, and reusing the materials, the overall cost for production would also decrease. Furthermore, the waste material will also decrease that is otherwise required to be released or dealt with. So you would also be saving from that side. Also, there will be less waste in packaging design. It will increase sustainability in manufacturing, operations and the supply chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, in 2018 a survey was conducted by World Business Council for Sustainable Development, it founded that companies, the study included overall 141 different companies, that used sustainable strategies performed better in almost every market segment than their respective counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can help you see all the reasons why you immediately need to change your  Custom Packaging  approach and switch towards more nature sustainable solutions.</p>",

            "body"=> "<p>Having the back of great supportive material is the need of many. In essence, this back provides them a great option likewise. Having good support releases pressure off you for example. Moreover, you will consider it a valuable partner to your needs. Brands and businesses strive on this partnership, and they look to gain one likewise. But the support of a perfect partner is a rare thing these days. Different industries exist today that do not have the exact requirements they require. However, they try to obtain the opportunities that come their way. Brands and businesses have to face different challenges presently. These include monetary problems and production issues in addition. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But one key issue they usually face is after they manufacture their product. Many brands do not manufacture products but have to deliver them. It is simple to consider business alone. But there is a useful factor that applies to them. And that is to have a packaging partner to team up with. This partner is not a firm or a business but a product. Boxes find great importance when people look to pack their useful goods. Each new product carries brilliant ingredients and components. But if they do not find usage ideally, there is no demand. To kill off this idea of fewer sales, brands take care of promotional needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"rigid-boxes\" src=\"/frontend-assets/assets/blogpost_img/rigid-boxes2.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, they have to spend a lot to achieve their targets. And this will mean looking for help from somewhere else. But they do not find a good supporter and friend. However, there is one option for them in terms of boxes. We bring the importance of boxes and will continue until people get benefit from them. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rigid Boxes or Set-up Boxes </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A box that you hear about or see-through an image is not the only thing. In essence, a single box is not a single or uniform. Each box brings different importance and usage. Thus, brands make use of the ideal ones. These useless boxes do not turn out as useless for all. They find usage in another brand for another product. Hence, the cycle continues until the box turns out as a different product. Or turns out for different usage. Among boxes, one key box type is <a href=\"https=>//bestcustomboxes.co.uk/product/rigid-boxes/\">Rigid Boxes</a>. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>These boxes also go by the name of Set-up Boxes, but the usage and quality remain the same. Ideally, these lie under the same branch of packaging boxes. However, this is the quality of boxes that look unique and iconic. Moreover, they present different styles so people can use them diversely. A box is known as rigid since it carries great stiffness. Although much more important comes with these boxes. But their great strength finds immense popularity among different brands. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A business that has to rely on a safe transfer of goods requires these boxes likewise. In addition, their primary use also comes as offering support like a base. Generally, the storage area of the products comes from different materials. But these materials require a perfect base to settle over. This comes from the boxes that have to offer rigidness. With rigidness comes great strength that different brands require. Moreover, several goods or products require packing boxes to ensure safe travel and stacking. All of the boxes for packaging come with unique options. In essence, each box has to offer a special feature for specific products. However, there was a lack of boxes that cover the basics perfectly. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Boxes and Packaging </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For a long, there was a need to have a perfect packaging product. And a product that will serve the community ideally. There were many issues for manufacturers in the past. At first, there was a problem producing products from limited materials. After they produced a decent product, there was another issue to pack them ideally. But this problem does not exist presently since a new set of manufacturers get a place on the scene. These manufacturers have the responsibility to produce products only for offering to package. In essence, these products have to present a covering for precious goods of the industries. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among them came the boxes. Initially, there was a doubt regarding their usage. Many people still say that boxes have simplicity. But little do they know that <a href=\"https=>//bestcustomboxes.co.uk/blog/explore-the-ways-for-the-best-customization-of-rigid-boxes\">boxes offer useful customizations</a> for you. It means you can stylize them considering your requirements. Only the best brands and businesses took the bold step, and now they produce the ideal boxes themselves. Rigid Boxes emerge as the favorite type of boxes. It is since this box type has to offer and cover a great issue of the manufacturers. That is, packing and storing their goods safely. For this, the box for storing needs to have the ideal strength. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boxes with brilliant rigidness solve this problem ideally. Although they come in different styles likewise. Still, their primary goal and use are to provide a covering for good with great safety. For their great and important role, these boxes find the perfect use in many top industries. </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Board games cannot go into the markets with the use of Set-up Boxes </li>\r\n  <li>Jewelry and expensive watches only have one demand such as boxes with rigidness </li>\r\n  <li>Decorative products and gifts come with the perfect boxes carrying stiffness </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why does a Flexible Box Fail? </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no name like a flexible box, but it is an understanding for you. Firstly, you have to think through the perspective of the manufacturer. No producer in the world wants their products to go damaged into the hands of the users. This reduces their importance and public image. Thus, it will lead to low sales and less importance. A flexible box may be good for style and design. Moreover, it will be good to offer great advertisement opportunities. But without strength, it will not last long. Flexibility is good but with a strong backup. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started our discussion by claiming that good support is necessary. This is the ideal principle that comes into the use of Rigid Boxes. Such a box type has to offer good support and backup for your stylish packaging. Different boxes additionally require the support of such boxes to improve safety. Hence, security also comes with the use of these boxes alongside rigidness. But flexible boxes fail here badly. They only provide an attractive outlook, but the user finds no respite. In addition, the user has to carry them vice versa, and the product loses promotion. For this, boxes that carry a flexible design do not emerge on the scene ideally. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Low Sales of Rigid Boxes </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>But not everything is perfect when it comes to boxes with rigidity. Their importance and growth are slow in the market. Mostly, the reason is that their emergence is less. People still rely on stylish boxes or the ones with flexibility. But they do not understand that failure can occur anytime with this decision. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For such reasons, boxes with stiffness have less reach among the public. But this scenario will change soon when the importance increases. Set-up Boxes do not only offer support however they offer a complete package. With good strength, they also include customizations and additions that you require.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rigid Packaging Types </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, having a box does not allow us to think of additional features. But only the top manufacturers provide these features to find usage and importance. In essence, each box comes with multiple ways to promote more acceptance. A box with multiple variations suits different buyers. Hence, the sellers benefit ideally from a single product. But for this, they have to allow different additions likewise over time. Rigid Boxes come in different packaging styles or types. Each carries a different aspect. However, you will find that the packing sense is the same. Just a few additions and customizations and the box is ready to serve. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3> 1.  Partial or Half-Finish  </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is less time for manufacturers to cover the details perfectly. Moreover, sometimes the requirement is not to cover the details but work on the outlook. In such cases, the manufacturers make use of a partial filing or finishing in the box. Such a packaging type saves them time and promotes productivity. The outlook is perfect, but the inside remains raw. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But by raw, we mean that the inside carries no features. With a partial finish, your box will contain wrapping paper. This paper will cover the entire outer side but only the shoulders with the inside. For a simple understanding, take a look at your shoebox. That is the ideal representation of a partial finish method. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3> 2.  Full Finish </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now several manufacturers want to achieve perfection. They find the requirements and orders likewise to promote perfection and efficiency. Hence, for them, there is no respite in producing a box with a partial finish. For them, a box that comes with a full finishing is the ideal choice. Thus, such a packaging type also finds importance. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Producing such boxes takes time since every detail will find a wrapping. Even the smallest elements that will come out of the box will require covering. Understand a Set-up Box with such a packaging finish to be like a smartphone packing box. You will find the outlook rigid, but the color will be the same for each box element. Even for smaller components, the finish will be the same. It is what you can call a box with a full finish. Again, producing them will consume time, but the result will be a box with perfection and cleanliness. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making use of either packaging style depends on your needs and taste. For some, a partial finish is ideal rather than a full finish and vice versa. But if you have to consider the requirements from the seller, there is not much of your choice present. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rigid Boxes Styles  </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Boxes with unique but good rigidness do not come in a uniform style. Moreover, they do not only rely on packaging styles. In essence, their designs vary greatly likewise. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, we bring you the simplest option you will come across among boxes. Different styles find important, but the tube style has the best. For many brands, the ideal requirement is to have tube packaging. Rigid Boxes do not reflect a simple box. Their strength makes them a heavy-duty packing option. Hence, different styles will only promote their work. And that too without giving their stiffness a downfall. Such a style is common with medicines that come in tube packing. Such packing is easy to access offering easy packing. Moreover, the storage is favorable since the body is perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <h3>Tube-Style</h3>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, we bring you the simplest option you will come across among boxes.

This style is now becoming a symbol or trademark among boxes. Although there is little that is new importance is present. A magnetic option in the boxes allows sharp closing. Moreover, this sharp closing offers extra safety with good strength. There is the actual use of magnets in these boxes. One goes into the front side of the base. Whereas the other goes into the top side that extends on the front side of the base. When the two surfaces meet, there is the action of magnets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"rigid-boxes\" src=\"/frontend-assets/assets/blogpost_img/rigid-boxes4.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <h3>Telescope Style</h3>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Another style that is common among all box types is the telescope design or style.

Moreover, a unique thing about this style is that your box will have two halves. One will be the storage part where your products settle. And the other is the cover that will come on the top. Consider the style of ordinary shoeboxes to resemble them. Such a design is loved by many since it offers complete access to the products inside. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"rigid-boxes\" src=\"/frontend-assets/assets/blogpost_img/rigid-boxes6.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <h3>Drawer Style</h3>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a style or design only offers an additional feature to your box. These boxes reflect style more than anything. And their purpose and usage are likewise. A drawer style is perfect when you want to pack gifts inside. Moreover, boxes with this style carry importance to offer additional brilliance. Many brands favor these boxes since they present a great outlook.

But they have seen these boxes at least once. Such a style carries three elements that make a single box. There is a base, and within it is something we call a neck.
